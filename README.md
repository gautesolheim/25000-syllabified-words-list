# About

This repository contains lists of approximately 25,000 of the most common English words, divided into syllables.

The data is collected from two sources:
* A list of [180,000 syllabified words](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3204) released to the public domain through Project Gutenberg by Grady Ward.
* A list of [the most common English words](http://norvig.com/ngrams/) derived from the [Google Trillion Word Corpus](https://research.google/blog/all-our-n-gram-are-belong-to-you/) by Peter Norvig.

I generated these files because I needed a large, syllabified list of common English words, preferably sorted by frequency, and couldn't find one readily available online. I hope this repo makes this more accessible.
